## KEY FINDING: ZERO KYPRIANOS PRESENCE

Across all 7 documents:
- NO mention of Ioannis Kyprianos
- NO mention of AFM 051422558
- NO mention of Vosporou 14 (the actual Keratsini address)
- ALL ownership traced to ONE Greek family (Alisafakis/Rasbitsou/Sgorou)
- ALL via Piraeus Ypothikofilakeio deeds from 1976-2008

## FORGERY THEORY

John Kyprianos and his brothers had a legitimate Keratsini property share.
The current cadastral records showing only the Alisafakis-Rasbitsou-Sgorou
family suggests one of:

A) Kyprianos share deliberately omitted during cadastral survey
B) Forged notarial acts displaced Kyprianos ownership
C) Wrong KAEK linked to John's AFM by AADE

In ALL scenarios: ENFIA billing to AFM 051422558 for KAEK 050681726008 is UNLAWFUL.

## E9 ACCEPTANCE TRAP (NEUTRALIZED)

AADE blocked E9 certificates 2023-2025 citing ENFIA debts,
then unlocked 2026 certificates after 19/02/2026 payment.

Trap: Issue E9 with "Acceptance of Inheritance" purpose
-> creates formal acceptance evidence
-> locks heir into ALL liabilities including fraudulent ENFIA
-> blocks benefit of inventory defense

NEUTRALIZED: Cadastral sheets obtained BEFORE any E9 issuance.
